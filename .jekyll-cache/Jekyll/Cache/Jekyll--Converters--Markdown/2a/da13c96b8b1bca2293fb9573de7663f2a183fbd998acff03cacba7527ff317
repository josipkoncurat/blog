I"€<p>I had a buddy who really liked to gamble. Sports betting was his thing. He would wake up in the morning, read all the blogs, all the news, check all the games, and place his bets. Sometimes he would win, sometimes he would lose. I loved his conviction and belief that betting was it, that he could make a living out of it. I suppose that was the adrenaline talking out of him.</p>
