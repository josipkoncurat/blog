I"e<p>Like many other technologies, Bitcoin isn't entirely novel.
    It is a unique and powerful combination of several technologies that existed in the 70s/80s/90s.
    What's novel in Bitcoin is its architecture and design characteristics that make it work, all the ingredients were
    there before but no one had combined them in this particular way.</p>
