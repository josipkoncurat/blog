Bitcoin - the distributed, public blockchain.  Digital cash (or
digital gold) if you will.  Can you do with it all you could do with
cash?  In particular, can you go and shop to your heart's content
without any outsider knowing what you bought, from who at what price?
You can with cash.  How about bitcoin?
