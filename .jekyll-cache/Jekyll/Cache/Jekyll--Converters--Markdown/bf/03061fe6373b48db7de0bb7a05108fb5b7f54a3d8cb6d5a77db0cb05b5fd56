I"$<p>Hi all.
For my first blog post here on Blockchain Gang, I'll be writing about why I got started with blockchain technology, telling you a bit about myself and my interests.

<p>
As it happens, it's pure peer pressure.
In the form of not understanding what my friends are talking about on our beer fueled hangouts.
Jokes aside (while that kind of thing piqued my interest), I started to get into it as I came to understand what blockchain technology is about.
And it's about the things I like, mostly focused on the technological aspect.</p>
