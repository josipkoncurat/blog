If you've been reading blockchain-related websites, or listening to
podcasts on similar topics, you've probably come across the term
"ERC-20 token" in the context of Ethereum.  And you likely know that
ERC-20 is a standard about such "tokens".  So maybe you're asking
yourself some of the following questions (and if you are, that's great
because I'm about to answer them): What are tokens?  How are they
different from coins?  What are they used for?  What does a "standard
for tokens" even mean?  Why is such a standard even necessary or
useful?
