If you've been reading blockchain-related websites, or listening to
podcasts on similar topics, you've probably come across the term
"ERC-20 token" in the context of Ethereum.  And you likely know that
ERC-20 is a standard about such "tokens".  So maybe you're asking
yourself some of the following questions (and if you are, that's great
because I'm about to answer them): What are tokens?  How are they
different from coins?  What are they used for?  What does a "standard
for tokens" even mean?  Why is such a standard even necessary or
useful?
</p>

<p>
Let's start with some nomenclature.  "ERC" stands for "Ethereum
Request for Comments" and "20" is a number denoting this particular
ERC, about a certain kind of tokens in Ethereum.  ERC is a term
reminiscent of RFCs ("Request for Comments"), a similar concept in the
context of Internet standards.  Also, note that ERC-20 is a standard
for <i>fungible</i> tokens, meaning any two "pieces" of the same token
have the same value.  This is in opposition to non-fungible tokens,
which have their own standards, notably ERC-721.
</p>

<h3 id="org857ab55">What are tokens and how are they different from coins?</h3>
<p>
Coins have their own blockchain, tokens exist on a different
blockchain that has its own native coin.  In Ethereum, the native coin
is called 'ether' and tokens are created through smart contracts on
the Ethereum blockchain.  (Note that tokens were created even before
the standard ERC-20 was made.  Or rather, the fact that tokens were
being created was the incentive to create the standard)
</p>

<p>
From this explanation, one can see the usefulness of tokens.  One does
not need to implement a new blockchain or attract new users and miners
necessary for establishing a new cryptocurrency.  Instead, one can use
an existing platform with its blockchain, miners and users to create
your cryptocurrency (or rather, your token).
</p>

<p>
Let's look at the example of the Dai ERC-20 token.  Dai is a
stablecoin, the value of which is tied to the value of the US dollar,
mapped 1:1.  As any ERC-20 token, Dai was created on Ethereum
blockchain by having its smart contract implemented and then deployed
on Ethereum (thus tying it to an Ethereum address).  Anyone who wants
to do anything with the Dai token will go through this smart contract.
What can you do with a token?  You can e.g. transfer tokens from one
address to another or check token balance of an Ethereum address, and
so on (more on this later).  These functionalities were coded into the
smart contract, along with functionalities that tie the value of the
Dai token to the value of the US dollar.  The latter of those
functionalities are Dai-specific and not part of the ERC-20 standard.
On the other hand, transferring tokens between addresses and checking
the balance is part of the standard.
</p>

<h3 id="org5ede870">What does a "standard for tokens" even mean?</h3>
<p>
ERC-20 as a standard defines a set of functions that a token (or rather
its smart contract) must implement.  If the token implements these
functions, it is ERC-20-compliant.
</p>

<p>
The functions are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>balanceOf() - returns the token balance of a given Ethereum address</li>
<li>totalSupply() - returns the total supply of this token</li>
<li>transfer() - transfers some amount of tokens from the function
caller's address to another address</li>
<li>transferFrom() - similar to transfer(), it transfers some amount of
tokens from the sender's address to the recipient's address</li>
<li>approve() - authorizes the given address to withdraw a given amount
of tokens from the function caller's address</li>
<li>allowance() - related to approve(), it returns the remaining amount
of tokens the given address is allowed to withdraw from the function
caller's address</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you've had experience with object oriented programming, it's easy
to understand it as such: the ERC-20 is the interface that defines a
set of methods, and a class needs to implement this interface and
its methods if it wants to be considered ERC-20-compliant.
</p>

<h3 id="org0e4ac9c">Why is such a standard even necessary or useful?</h3>
<p>
Standards are needed for convenience of other applications that can
interact with tokens, so they could interact with many different
tokens and not just one.  Suppose there is no standard, and you are
creating a wallet application only for one particular token.  When
you're finished and people start using your wallet application,
suppose you decide to offer that same functionality for a different
token.  It would be great if you didn't have to rewrite parts of your
application just for that other token, and then again for a third
token.  If all those tokens follow a standard, then you don't have to.
You can use the application for all
standard-compliant tokens, including those that weren't created at the moment
you coded your wallet.  Why?  Because they behave in a
standardized fashion, and you code your wallet with expectations of
such behavior.

Before we wrap up, I'll give you a few examples of ERC-20 tokens,
alongside the previously mentioned Dai token.  WBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)
is a token that wraps a bitcoin into the Etehreum
blockchain, allowing it to be used on Ethereum.  ZRX is the token of the 0x
decentralized exchange protocol for trading ERC-20 tokens.  BAT, the
Basic Attention Token is to be used with the Brave browser, where
users can opt out of advertising, or opt in and be paid for it, in
BAT.  And many, many more.
