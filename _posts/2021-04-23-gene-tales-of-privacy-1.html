Tales on Privacy in Crypto: an Introduction

Bitcoin -- the distributed, public blockchain.  Digital gold, or
digital cash, if you will.  Can you do with it all you could do with
cash?  In particular, can you go and shop to your heart's content
without any outsider knowing what you bought, from who at what price?
You can with cash.  How about bitcoin?

In a bitcoin transaction, bitcoin is moved from one bitcoin address to
another.  Let's say you're a recepient in such a transaction.  Your
bitcoin address is just a random string of characters unrelated to
you, a person with an actual name and street address.  Meaning you can
make a financial transaction without your personal details being
written down anywhere in it.  However, that doesn't make bitcoin
actually private in many a use case.  Because, as stated at the start
of this post, bitcoin is a *public* blockchain.  All records of
transactions are visible to anyone who knows where to look.  This
means a couple of things:
1. If you make your personal data known to the other party involved in
   a transaction with you, all your transactions can be traced back to
   you if that other party reveals your data.
2. Even if you never reveal your data to another party, the way you
   exchange bitcoin can tell a lot about you.  Analytics over the
   network topology (the network of transactions) can potentially have
   your bitcoin address link back to you by analysing who you trade
   with, who those entities trade with, and so on.  As part of the
   analysis, the information about real world identities of many of
   those addresses is used, as not everyone keeps this hidden in the
   first place.  There are companies that specialize in this kind of
   analytics and there's plenty money and interest in this -- in
   other words this is a reality, not a possibility.

For all you folks that have not much interest in anonymity, but are
still reading for some reason, I'll give you a more tangible reason to
continue: lack of anonymity in bitcoin makes it /not really fungible/.
You see, 1BTC that's freshly minted != 1BTC that has a criminal
transaction history (criminal in the literal sense).  The freshly
minted coin is worth more to a potential buyer because it comes with
no history (no *bad* history).  For example, if coins were stolen from
its owner at some point, it's not impossible that authorities will
attempt to return those coins to the original owner.  The risk of this
makes them less attractive to the prospective bitcoin buyer.

So is there a way to use bitcoin anonymously?  Why it's simple of
course!  You buy it in cash, don't leak your details ever, and trade
it only with other bitcoin holders that do those first two things as
well!  Not really useful, right?

Actually, there is a better way - using coin mixers (tumblers).  This
is the general idea: you transfer your coins to the mixer service, which
similarly receives coins from other parties, and they are "mixed
together".  Then, you get the same amount of coins you sent in the
mixer back, randomly chosen from this large mix of coins -- in other
words, you don't get the same coins that you put in, but coins with a
different history.  This isn't a free service, you pay a small
percentage of the coins that you send to the service.

There's a few problems with this:
1. It isn't free, you pay for it.
2. It isn't part of the bitcoin protocol, it's something that must be
   done manually.
3. Mixing large sums of money may in some cases be considered illegal,
   in violation of anti-structuring laws.
4. You need to trust the bitcoin mixing party that it will really
   return your coins to you (this is a minor point of concern, it
   mearly means to be cautious when making your pick).

Attempts have been made to address these issue and make crypto with
built-in privacy.  I'll give a brief overview of a relatively well
known one and how it works: Monero.

Monero does three things:
1. hides the recepient of the transaction
2. hides the sender of the transaction
3. hides the amount of Monero spent/received in a transaction
In short, all the relevant parts of a transaction are hidden from
everyone who isn't an involved party.

Obviously, a lot goes on under the hood to make this happen.  Ring
signatures are used to obfuscate the sender of a transaction.  Instead
of using one key to sign a transaction, a ring of multiple keys is
used and they are all possible signers of the transaction, therefore
hiding who exactly is the sender.  Instead of using the real public
address of your account to receive Monero, a one-time stealth address
is created for each transaction.  Only the recepient of the
transaction can know that the transaction was meant for them.  The
amount is obfuscated by the algorithm "Ring Confidential
Transactions".

From its design up, Monero is a private blockchain.  Even though it's
distributed and relies on users running full copies of it and mining
blocks, the details of transactions are undecipherable to anyone who
isn't an involved party of a transaction.  The protocol nonetheless
allows miners to verify the validity of transactions as they add them
to the blockchain.  For the recepient and sender of Monero, this
process is transparent.  Using it is similar to using other
cryptocurrencies: you have a public address for receiving funds, a
private "spend key" for initiating and viewing sending transaction,
and a private view key, for viewing incoming transactions.

A more detailed explanation of innerworkings of Monero is out of scope
of this post.  This is more an illustration of how it can be done, and
an example that crypto can be private.
