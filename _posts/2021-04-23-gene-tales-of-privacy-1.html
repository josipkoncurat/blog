Bitcoin - the distributed, public blockchain.  Digital cash (or
digital gold) if you will.  Can you do with it all you could do with
cash?  In particular, can you go and shop to your heart's content
without any outsider knowing what you bought, from who at what price?
You can with cash.  How about bitcoin?
</p>

<p>
In a bitcoin transaction, bitcoin is moved from one bitcoin address to
another.  Let's say you're a recipient in such a transaction.  Your
bitcoin address is just a random string of characters unrelated to
you, a person with an actual name and street address.  This means that
with bitcoin, you can make a financial transaction which doesn't
contain your personal details.  However, that doesn't make bitcoin
actually private in many use cases.  Because, as stated at the start
of this post, bitcoin is a <b>public</b> blockchain.  All records of
transactions are visible to anyone who knows where to look.  This
means a couple of things:
<ul>
  <li>
    If you make your personal data known to the other party involved
    in a transaction with you, all your transactions can be traced
    back to you if that other party reveals your data.  For example,
    if you buy bitcoin for dollars at an online cryptocurrency
    exchange platform, you probably have to go through a KYC process
    where you give your identification and bank account information.
    So from the first moment you buy bitcoin at that exchange, someone
    other than you knows the link between your bitcoin address and
    your real identity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Even if you never reveal your data to another party, the way you
    exchange bitcoin can tell a lot about you.  Analytics over the
    network topology (the network of transactions) can potentially
    have your bitcoin address link back to you by analysing who you
    trade with, who those entities trade with, and so on.  As part of
    the analysis, the information about real world identities of many
    of those addresses is used, as not everyone keeps this hidden in
    the first place.  There are companies that specialize in this kind
    of analytics and there's plenty money and interest in this - in
    other words this is a reality, not a possibility.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For all you folks that have not much interest in anonymity, but are
still reading for some reason, I'll give you a more tangible reason to
continue: lack of anonymity in bitcoin makes it <i>not really
fungible</i>.  You see:

<p><blockquote> 1BTC that is freshly minted &ne; 1BTC that has
a criminal transaction history (criminal in the literal sense)
</blockquote></p>

<p>
The freshly minted coin is worth more to a potential buyer because it
comes with no history (no <i>bad</i> history).  For example, if coins
were stolen from its owner at some point, it's not impossible that
authorities will attempt to return those coins to the original owner.
This risk makes them less attractive to the prospective bitcoin buyer.
Although, not every buyer will know this or attempt to check it.
</p>

<p>
So is there a way to use bitcoin anonymously?  Why it's simple of
course!  You buy it in cash, don't leak your details ever, and trade
it only with other bitcoin holders that do those first two things as
well!  Not really useful, right?
</p>

<p>
Actually, there is a better way - using coin mixers (tumblers).  This
is the general idea: you transfer your coins to the mixer service,
which similarly receives coins from other parties, and they are "mixed
together".  Then, you get the same amount of coins you sent in the
mixer back, randomly chosen from this large mix of coins -- in other
words, you don't get the same coins that you put in, but coins with a
different history.  This isn't a free service, you pay a small
percentage of the coins that you send to the service.
</p>

<p>
  There's a few problems with this:
  <ul>
    <li>
      It isn't free, you pay for it.
    </li>
    <li>
      It isn't part of the bitcoin protocol, it's something that must
      be done manually.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mixing large sums of money may in some cases be considered
      illegal, in violation of anti-structuring laws.
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to trust the bitcoin mixing party that it will really
      return your coins to you (this is a minor point of concern, it
      merely means to be cautious when making your pick of the mixing
      service).
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
Again - is there a better way?  Yes, a cryptocurrency with built-in
privacy.  I'll give a brief overview of a relatively well known one
and how it works: Monero.
</p>

<p>
  Monero does three things:
  <ol>
    <li>
      hides the recipient of a transaction
    </li>
    <li>
      hides the sender of a transaction
    </li>
    <li>
      hides the amount of Monero spent/received in a transaction
    </li>
  </ol>
  In short, all the relevant parts of a transaction are hidden from
  everyone who isn't an involved party.
</p>

<p>
Obviously, a lot goes on under the hood to make this happen.  Ring
signatures are used to obfuscate the sender of a transaction.  Instead
of using one key to sign a transaction, a ring of multiple keys is
used and they are all possible signers of the transaction, therefore
hiding who exactly is the sender.  Instead of using the real public
address of your account to receive Monero, a one-time stealth address
is created for each transaction.  Only the recipient of the
transaction can know that the transaction was meant for them.  The
amount is obfuscated by the algorithm "Ring Confidential
Transactions".
</p>

<p>
From its design up, Monero is a private blockchain.  Even though it's
distributed and relies on users running full copies of the blockchain
and mining blocks, the details of transactions are undecipherable to
anyone who isn't an involved party of a transaction.  The protocol
nonetheless allows miners to verify the validity of transactions as
they add them to the blockchain.  For the recipient and sender of
Monero, this process is transparent.  Using it is similar to using
other cryptocurrencies: you have a public address for receiving funds,
a private "spend key" for initiating and viewing sending transaction,
and a private view key, for viewing incoming transactions.
</p>

<p>
A more detailed explanation of inner workings of Monero is out of scope
of this post.  This is more an illustration of how it can be done, and
an example that crypto can be private.
